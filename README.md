Project for a responsive motion chair integrated with the G-force feedback from the Assetto Corsa Competizione simulator, developed using scrap materials. The objective is to design and implement a low-cost motion system capable of simulating ground elevation changes and lateral/longitudinal force feedback (“push” during cornering and braking/acceleration). The control system will be developed in Python, responsible for data acquisition and processing from the simulator’s telemetry, while an Arduino-based microcontroller will drive actuators and motors to reproduce the physical movements on the chair. The aim is to enhance realism and competitiveness by providing an immersive and dynamic driving experience.
